 * \brief   Stream-Oriented Modulator Interface.

 *
 * Defines common interface for stream-oriented blockmodem classes. A stream-
 * oriented blockmodem is one which can determine frame synchronization and
 * can make use of a-priori information for start and end of frame positions.
 * It is also an 'informed' modulator in that it can use a-priori symbol
 * probabilities during the demodulation stage. In general, such a blockmodem
 * is used with synchronization-correcting codes and can also be used in an
 * iterative loop with the channel codec. Such a blockmodem can also determine
 * posterior probabilities for the start and end of frame positions.
 *
 * This interface is a superset of the informed blockmodem, defining new
 * (vector) demodulation methods that make use of prior frame-edge information.
 * Overloaded versions are provided to work with or without prior symbol
 * information, as well as to return (or not) posterior frame-edge information.

    * \param[in]  chan     The channel model (used to obtain likelihoods)
    * \param[in]  rx       Sequence of received symbols

    *                      (zero-index matches N-index of rx, where N is the
    *                      length of the transmitted frame)
    * \param[in]  app      Prior probabilities of transmitted sequence
    * \param[out] ptable   Posterior probabilities of transmitted sequence
    * \param[out] sof_post Posterior probabilities for start-of-frame position
    *                      (zero-index matches zero-index of rx)
    * \param[out] eof_post Posterior probabilities for end-of-frame position
    *                      (zero-index matches N-index of rx, where N is the
    *                      length of the transmitted frame)
    * \param[in]  offset   Index offset for prior, post, and rx vectors
    *
    * \note To avoid the need for a container class that can take a non-zero
    *       index, the user needs to supply an offset value. This is needed for
    *       both prior and post containers as well as for the rx container.
    *       The offsets are defined in a positive way, so that the physical
    *       index is equal to the virtual index + offset.
    *
    * \todo Remove offset and replace vector types with ones that can take a
    *       non-zero index.
    *
    * \note \c ptable(i,d) \c is the posterior probability of having transmitted
    * symbol 'd' at time 'i'
    *
    * \note This function is non-const, to support time-variant modulation
    * schemes such as DM inner codes.
    *
    * \note app and ptable may point to the same space
    *
    * \note app may be empty; this should be taken to indicate that no prior
    * information is available
