 *
 * Class created to allow the implementation of serialization functions
 * similar to MFC's. Concept is that derived classes should have a static
 * const serializer object within the class, which should be constructed
 * by giving it:
 * - the name of the derived class,
 * - the name of its base class (to which we would like to add support),
 * - and a pointer to a function which creates a new object of the derived
 * type. This would ideally be a static function for the derived class.
 * The base class then has access to these functions through a static
 * serializer function, to which it needs to give:
 * - its own name (ie that of the base class),
 * - and the derived class's name, the one to which it needs access.
 * This can be used within an istream >> function to dynamically create
 * & load a derived class object.
 *
 * In serializable classes, the stream << output function first writes the
 * name of the derived class, then calls its serialize() to output the data.
 * The name is obtained from the virtual name() function.
 * Similarly, the stream >> input function first gets the name from the stream,
 * then (via serialize::call) creates a new object of the appropriate type and
 * calls its serialize() function to get the relevant data.
 *
 * \note In the constructor, the function pointer is passed directly, not by
 * reference. This is required to pass anything except global functions.
 *
 * \note The map is held as a static pointer to map. For some obscure reason,
 * static or global maps are leading to access violations. The pointer is
 * initially NULL, and when the first serializer object is created, space
 * for this is allocated.
 * A static counter keeps track of how many serializer objects are
 * defined. When this drops to zero, the global map is deallocated. Note
 * that this should only drop to zero on program end, assuming all
 * serializer objects are created with either global or static member
 * scope.
 *
 * \note Macros are defined to standardize declarations in serializable
 * classes; this mirrors what Microsoft do in MFC.
